- Most important: Create process on how to define boffset for each country. File config file where everything is defined. The normal offset and each countries offset.
- Based on this collect all countries automatically

Next steps: 
    1) Create good base offsets
    2) Bring them into config file and import them
    3) Create Offsets for each country and implement process
